Hi there! I am currently enrolled in the Masters by Research program at the CSE department, IIT Bombay. My chosen area is Intelligent Systems, and I am broadly interested in geometric deep learning, graph machine learning, network science and information diffusion. My research advisor is Prof. Abir De.

Prior to this, I worked as a full-stack software engineer at Instahyre, a recruitment startup whose product matches candidates to jobs in a hassle-free manner and with reasonably high accuracy. I was promoted to Head of Engineering for my contributions and had a great time there in general.

PS: This is an experiment with the al-folio academic pages theme. Hopefully it works out.
